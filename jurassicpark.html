       <p >Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts One and Two is the official script book for the play of the same name written by J. K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne.
It was marketed as the "eighth story" of Harry Potter, taking place after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

J. K. Rowling, prior to the books' release and the official play's opening night, wanted the plot of the play to remain a secret for as long as possible. Following the opening night of the first preview of the play, she started a #KeepTheSecrets campaign.

The script book was released on 31 July 2016, the day of the opening night following the previews. Many bookstores around the world hosted midnight release parties. The Definitive Edition of the script was released on 25 July 2017.
Part I
Act I
Scenes One and Two
The play begins on Platform 9 3/4 and picks up from where Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows left off, with a few modifications. Albus Potter and Rose Granger-Weasley say goodbye to their parents and board the train. Harry Potter, Ginevra Weasley, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger wonder whether their children will be okay. Ron remembers his time at Hogwarts.

Scene Three
Albus and Rose wander around the train looking for a compartment to sit in. Rose reminds Albus that their parents met on the train, so decides that finding the right compartment to sit in is very important as they too could meet their lifelong friends here. They open the door to one compartment and find Scorpius Malfoy sitting there. They shyly introduce themselves and Scorpius makes a joke about their parents rivalry. Albus and Scorpius get along very well, but Rose leaves to look for another compartment because she thinks that Scorpius is nothing but trouble. Albus stays and the two become friends, sharing stories and sweets on the journey to Hogwarts.
